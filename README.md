This project simply aims to provide data hiding in images that isnt visible to naked eyes.
Requirements:
Python's opencv library
Python's os library
Python's string library

I have separated the encryption and decryption code if anybody needs it.
The main file is stego.py,
while encryption file is encryption.py and decryption file is decryption.py.
